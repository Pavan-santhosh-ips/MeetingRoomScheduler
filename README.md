### Meeting Room Scheduler â€“ Java LLD Project

Welcome to the **Meeting Room Scheduler**, a project that simulates how companies manage room bookings â€” minus the chaos of double-bookings or conflicts.

This was built as part of my hands-on practice with **Low-Level Design (LLD)** and **Object-Oriented Principles**.  
Itâ€™s fully interactive via the command line, designed using the **Strategy Design Pattern**, and keeps things simple yet scalable.

##  What Problem Does It Solve?

Imagine you're managing multiple meetings across different rooms in an office.

 How do you ensure two meetings donâ€™t overlap in the same room?  
 Thatâ€™s exactly what this scheduler does â€” it finds the first available room where a new meeting can fit without clashing with existing ones.

## Key Features

-  Take user input interactively (meeting title, start and end time)
-  Automatically assigns an available meeting room
-  Prevents overlapping/conflicting meetings
-  Displays a final clean schedule grouped by room
-  Built with extensibility in mind (plug in more strategies)

---

##  Why I Built This

As someone preparing for top company placements, I wanted to go beyond just solving Leetcode and DSA.  
This project helped me practice:

- Writing clean modular code
- Using design patterns effectively
- Thinking about system extensibility
- Structuring a Java application the way real teams do

##  Design Pattern: Strategy Pattern

Room allocation is handled via the **Strategy Pattern**, allowing dynamic switching of the scheduling logic.

**Implemented Strategy:**
- `FirstAvailableRoomStrategy`: Assigns the first room with no conflicts

**Interfaces:**
- `ISchedulingStrategy`: Enables future strategies like:
  - `LeastUsedRoomStrategy`
  - `PriorityBasedStrategy`
  - `CostOptimizedStrategy`
